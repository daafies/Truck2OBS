# Truck2OBS
this software requires ets2-telemetry-server installed and running.  ( https://github.com/Funbit/ets2-telemetry-server )

it creates txt files in the following location, which can be read into OBS to display route information. 

- c:/tmp/etsatsroute.txt (route info)

separated info:
- c:/tmp/cargo.txt (what's being hauled)
- c:/tmp/destcity.txt (destination city)
- c:/tmp/startcity.txt (city where load was picked up)
- c:/tmp/distance.txt (remaining distance)
- c:/tmp/game.txt (ats or ets2)


more features are being planned.
